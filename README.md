# Islanbridge Fitness Website
Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my first Milestone Project for Code Institute. It is a website created to advertise the Islandbridge Fitness Gym, in order to attract and retain a higher number of customers from Dublin 8 area and other parts of the city.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://fredveloper.github.io/milestone-project1/).

## UX
My goal in the design was to reflect the gym’s relevant information for potential and existing customers through a modern, dynamic, responsive and user-friendly web design. The website consists of a scroll-down page, divided into 6 sections (Home, Memberships, Classes, Facilities, Timetables and Join) where the user can easily navigate and find clear details about the gym.

For new users, I wanted to provide information on the three available memberships and their different costs, this was implemented using Bootstrap's cards. Through a carousel of images, I wanted to show all the classes offered by the gym and a brief description of each of them so that all the customers will have a clear idea and can attend the class of their choice. A downloadable PDF file is available to show the classes timetables, specifying the exact gym’s room where the class will take place. Likewise, the images of the gym's facilities which all customers can enjoy, as they are included in any of the memberships available. Lastly, a registration form was also designed for users to Join the Gym.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3.1)

## Features

The gradient animated background gives the website a fresh and dynamic look.
The navbar stays fixed to the top area when displaying in desktop screens and shrinks to a toggle button when displayed in smaller devices.
In mobile devices, the overlaid text disappears, and all the images are fully displayed to improve the user's experience.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I wish to add more features to this website, such as the functionality of online booking for the gym's classes, and the option to process online payments using different payment methods (debit card, credit, PayPal). 

At the design level, I would like to use more advanced tools to display the images using other animations for the images and the text simultaneously, while maintaining a responsive design.

## Testing
The customers can access all the sections of the website from different screen sizes. 

On a desktop view, the users are able to scroll-down through all the website’s sections. Alternatively, they can jump on to a specific section using the links in the navbar area or the quick links on the footer area. They can see full-size carousels and cards with images and information about the gym’s memberships, classes, and facilities. They are able to download the classes timetables by clicking on the “Timetables” link in the navbar area, a link located in the “Classes” section or the quick link in the footer.

A content divider is displayed between the website’s sections. The dividers contain fitness slogans to encourage users to join the gym.

They can access the registration form either through the “Join” link in the navbar area, the “Join Now” buttons located in the welcome and “Memberships” section or through the quick links in the footer. Registration input fields have the “required” attribute, therefore the users will receive an error message indicating that all fields must be completed for the form to be submitted.

They can see the information contained in the footer: gym’s location and contact details, opening hours, quick links and social media links.

All links were manually tested to guarantee they are pointing to the correct destination. The attribute “target=_blank” is present in the links, so they will always open in a new tab of the default browser.

## Deployment
The website is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. For the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, the repository can be cloned directly into the editor of your choice by pasting ‘git clone https://github.com/fredveloper/milestone-project1.git’ into your terminal.
